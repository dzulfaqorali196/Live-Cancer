          </li>
          <li>
            You represent that your access and use of the Creation will fully

        <h3 className="mt-6 text-lg font-semibold">Risks</h3>
        <p className="mt-4">
          By accessing and participating in the Creation, you represent that you
          understand the financial and technical risks associated with using
          cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, including:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>
            The markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly volatile
            due to factors including adoption, speculation, technology,
            security, and regulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone can create fake versions of tokens and falsely claim to
            represent projects. You accept the risk of mistakenly trading those.
          </li>
          <li>
            Smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and
            blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cost and speed of transacting on Ethereum may vary
            significantly.

            We are not responsible for any such risks, do not own or control the
