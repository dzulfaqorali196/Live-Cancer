project_overview:
  description: "Fungi, encompassing mycelium and mushrooms, represent Earth's largest and one of its oldest biological kingdoms. They are vital to ecosystems: recycling nutrients, decomposing matter, and forming symbiotic plant relationships. Fungi sustain soil health, enable plant communication, and generate life-supporting compounds. Evidence suggests they may have preceded plants and animals, shaping early ecosystems with their resilience in extreme conditions."
  emphasis: "Recognizing 'funga' alongside flora and fauna emphasizes fungi's role in biodiversity. Mycology explores their adaptive metabolism and potential to transform medicine, clean environments, and advance biotech. With abilities to break down pollutants, capture carbon, and create novel antibiotics, fungi offer critical solutions for climate and ecological restoration. Integrating fungi into science and policy unlocks new pathways for planetary resilience."

value_capture_model:
  description: "MycoDAO captures value through a robust MYCO token ecosystem, enabling governance, staking, and incentivized participation. It tokenizes IP, such as DNA sequences and fungal strains, enabling fractional ownership and revenue from licensing agreements. A tiered biobank access model provides free or subsidized access for non-profits and fee-based access for commercial entities. Decentralized funding supports innovative research via open proposals voted on by token holders, bypassing traditional grant systems. Partnerships with industries like biotech, agriculture, and conservation drive commercialization and large-scale environmental projects. Tools like LAB-IN-A-BOX generate revenue from DNA sequencing and culturing, while platforms like NatureOS and MINDEX monetize data licensing. Citizen science programs enhance biobank diversity, and workshops foster new researchers. By aligning decentralized governance with ecological and industrial solutions, MycoDAO democratizes fungal science and sustains innovation globally."
