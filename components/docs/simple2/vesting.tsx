          The vesting program is designed to ensure long-term commitment to
          CancerFunâ€™s mission. By releasing tokens gradually over time, it
          incentivizes sustained engagement, responsible stewardship, and
          alignment between contributors and the success of the research
          ecosystem.
        </p>

          Detailed specifications and documentation for these Solana-native
          programs will be added to the Docs soon. If you&apos;re a developer or
          researcher interested in early access, join us on Discord to get
          involved.
