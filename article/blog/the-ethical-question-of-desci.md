The decentralization of science or _DeSci_ has been hailed as a revolutionary shift in how we conduct and finance research. In a world where scientific discovery has long been governed by elite institutions, opaque peer review boards, and political priorities, DeSci offers a refreshing alternative: community-driven funding, open-access data, and incentive structures that reward transparency and merit. But as the movement gains traction, particularly in the field of cancer research, a fundamental ethical question lingers: _who gets to fund a cure, and at what cost?_

#### **Power, Access, and the Democratization Dilemma**

On paper, DeSci promises egalitarianism. Anyone with an internet connection and capital, be it $10 or $10,000, can contribute to scientific progress. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) allow a community to collectively vote on which projects receive funding, shifting decision-making from a handful of institutions to a broader, global participant base.

But democratization isn’t the same as equity. In practice, the loudest voices in DAOs are often those with the most tokens, a dynamic eerily similar to venture capitalism, just wrapped in different code. Token-weighted voting risks replicating plutocracy under the guise of open participation. If a cancer research DAO is heavily influenced by a few whales (large holders), can it truly represent the interests of patients, underfunded researchers, or low-income communities disproportionately affected by cancer?

#### **The Problem of Prioritization**

Traditional institutions, for all their flaws, are guided (at least nominally) by ethics boards, scientific review panels, and frameworks that consider long-term impact, patient safety, and diversity of representation. DeSci DAOs, by contrast, are still figuring out how to balance _urgency_, _impact_, and _popularity_.

What gets funded in this new model? Therapies that offer rapid proof-of-work? Projects with charismatic founders and slick pitch decks? Or those that align with community hype cycles? If left unchecked, there’s a risk that slow, high-risk, or unglamorous research, often where the most difficult cancer questions lie, will be ignored in favor of what’s “token-worthy.”

#### **Transparency vs. Exploitation**

DeSci enables traceability, every vote, wallet address, and fund disbursement is on-chain. But transparency is not synonymous with fairness. What mechanisms ensure that contributors from the Global South aren’t exploited for data and labor without proportional benefit? How do we prevent a new form of “biocolonialism” where the decentralized West crowdsources trials, data, or research from regions with less regulatory protection?

Similarly, how do we protect patient data in a world where health records might one day be tokenized and traded as part of an incentivized research ecosystem?

#### **Redefining “Public Good” in the Age of Protocols**

Perhaps the biggest shift DeSci brings isn’t technological, but philosophical. It challenges us to redefine what we consider a public good, and who is responsible for funding it. Is scientific research a commons that should be collectively owned? Should private capital determine the trajectory of life-saving breakthroughs? And most provocatively: if a cure for cancer were developed through a decentralized network, who would own it?

#### **Toward a More Ethical DeSci Future**

The promise of DeSci is real, but its success hinges on more than just smart contracts and governance tokens. It requires the intentional design of ethical frameworks that embed justice, inclusivity, and accountability at every layer, from protocol logic to funding criteria.

This means establishing weighted voting systems that account for stakeholder diversity, not just capital power. It means designing compensation models that reward not just success, but participation, data contribution, and collaborative integrity. And perhaps most crucially, it demands that the scientific community, ethicists, and patients alike shape the protocols, not just coders and crypto-native investors.

DeSci might be building the rails for a faster, more open future of discovery. But if we want that future to be just, if we truly want to cure, not just disrupt, we must ask: **_who gets to fund a cure, and who gets left behind if we don’t get it right?_**
