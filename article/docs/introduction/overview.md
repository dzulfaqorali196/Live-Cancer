# Overview

Bio is a new financial layer for funding and developing early-stage biotech. Our mission is to reshape how biotech breakthroughs are born by enabling global communities of patients, researchers, and crypto users to create user-owned research networks that fund and develop new and emerging biotechnologies from day one​.

At its core, Bio is designed to help scientists raise funds for their research, create value from that research, and capture and distribute that value via commercial successes.

By breaking down traditional biotech barriers and introducing a permissionless framework, Bio can accelerate life-saving discoveries while making them more accessible to all.
